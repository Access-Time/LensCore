# Refactor PR

## Goals
What is being improved (readability, architecture, performance, etc.).

## Scope
Which code areas/components are touched.

## Impact
Expected behavior changes (there should be none for a pure refactor).

## Checklist
- [ ] Test coverage does not decrease
- [ ] No API/contract changes without strong justification
- [ ] Reduced complexity / improved structure
- [ ] Lint & build pass
